# PORTFOLIO-ALGO-TRADING
Projects portfolio in algorithmic trading.

## (1) Algo-trading framework with LSTMs
- The goal of this project is to present a pipeline for predicting stocks with LSTM-based deep learning models.
- I demonstrate how to predict the AAPL stock with models which raise in complexity, up to a CNN-LSTM architecture.
- The prediction is of the adjusted closing price of the next day, based on the prices in the previous 60 days.
- In the future, a main approach for improving the results will be to add the rest of the price features and to add technical indicators.
