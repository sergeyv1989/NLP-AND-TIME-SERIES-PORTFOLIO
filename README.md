# NLP and time series portfolio
Projects portfolio in natural language processing and time series (sequence models).

## (1) Algorithmic trading pipeline with LSTMs
- The goal of this project is to present a pipeline for predicting stock prices with LSTM-based deep learning models.
- I demonstrate how to predict the adjusted closing price of a stock at the next day, based on its prices during a number of previous days.
- The models raise in complexity, up to a state-of-the-art CNN-LSTM architecture.
- To further improve the results, the main approach should be to add more price features and technical indicators.
